            When we decide to learn a new and important skill, there are often two ways to go about it.
        </p>
        <p class="control__descr article-descr">
            First, there is the solo path. This requires great discipline. You spend your own time researching, gathering information from countless sources, and figuring things out through trial and error. It is a path of self-reliance, but it can take a lot of time to find a clear direction.
        </p>
        <p class="control__descr article-descr">
            Then, there is the guided path. This involves following a structured program where the knowledge is organized for you, step-by-step. You learn through practical exercises designed to build your skills, and you can share experiences with a community of fellow learners who are on the same journey.

        </p>
        <p class="control__descr article-descr">
            There is no single "right" way. The choice is simply about which approach best fits your life and helps you move forward with clarity and confidence.
