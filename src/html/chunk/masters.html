            <span>What is this ‘Royal Sword’?</span> It is a $100,000 real trading account, funded by a proprietary trading firm (a prop firm). These are professional organizations that are constantly searching for talented traders. They have the capital; they just need skilled men to manage it. We have built a bridge for our best brothers to access that capital.

            <span>How Do You Earn It? The Two-Stage Trial</span> To prove you are ready, you must pass a two-stage challenge on a demo account. This is your trial. Not a trial of luck, but a trial of discipline and skill.

                <span>Stage 1 (Profitability):</span> Your mission is to reach a profit target of +8%. There is no time limit. Your only job is to follow the strategy and manage risk, with clear rules: no more than a 5% loss in one day or 10% total.

            <div class="stage-item">
                <span>Stage 2 (Stability):</span> Once you pass the first stage, you prove your consistency. Your next mission is a +6% profit target with the same risk rules.

            Stop and think what this means. This is the power to finally say YES. Yes to the best college for your kids. Yes to the house your wife dreams about. Yes to the comfortable life your parents deserve. You are no longer limited by your own savings. You are leveraging your mind to fulfill your duty as a Bayani on a level you never thought possible.
