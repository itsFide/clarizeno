            To give you a feel for our approach, here is a simple exercise you can try. It's called the "7-Minute Spending Journal."

        </p>
        <p class="days__descr article-descr">
            The instruction is simple: at the end of your day, take just 7 minutes to write down where your money went. No judgment, no analysis, and no need to change anything. Just a simple log of your expenses.

        </p>

            The purpose of this exercise is not to save money. Its only goal is to build the habit of awareness. By simply observing your own patterns without pressure, you begin to understand your own mindset on a deeper level.

            Consider this a small, powerful first step toward greater self-understanding.
