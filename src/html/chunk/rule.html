            On the Path of Control, a man’s honor is everything. That is why our entire brotherhood is built on two unbreakable rules. You must understand them before you take another step.

        <h3 class="rule__subtitle">Rule #1: Your Shield (You ALWAYS Control The Money)</h3>
        <p class="rule__descr article-descr">
            Let's be very, very clear, kabayan. In a world full of scams, your first weapon must be a shield. Your money STAYS in YOUR ‘Personal Vault’ (your OKX, Binance or other exchange account). Always.
        </p>
        <p class="rule__descr article-descr">
            Think of us as the tanod (the village watchman) who guards your house from the outside. We can see opportunities, we can give you a battle plan, we can warn you of danger. But we can NEVER enter your house. We cannot touch your family’s savings. You, and only you, hold the key to the door. We have ZERO access to your funds. This is your ultimate shield. Your honor, and your family's future, are safe.
        </p>
        <h3 class="rule__subtitle">Rule #2: Your Proof (The Results That Build Your Legacy)</h3>
        <p class="rule__descr article-descr">
            Talk is cheap, diba? A man needs to see proof. So let’s talk about real results, the bricks that build your family’s financial home.

            You can begin this journey with a minimum deposit of just $200 in your own private account. From there, what can you expect? Our community strategies are designed to target an average potential return of <span>5% to 20% per month in dollars.</span>

            I know, percentages can sound boring. What does this really mean for your pamilya? It’s Juan, who started small and eventually sent an extra $112 to his aging parents. That is not just money. That is Utang na Loob (debt of gratitude) in action. That is the pride in their eyes. It’s Carlos, who used an extra $80 to pay for his daughter’s college entrance exam review. That is a direct investment in her future, a future you are building with your own mind, not just the sweat of your brow.

        <p class="rule__descr article-descr">
            This is not a ‘get rich quick’ fantasy. This is ‘build your legacy, brick by brick.’ The first bricks may seem small, but soon they become the foundation of a storm-proof house for your family. The proof is in the lives you change, starting with your own.
