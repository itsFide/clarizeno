            We all know the modern-day Bayani. The OFW. The hero of the pamilya. He chooses the Path of Sacrifice. The pain of being away from them… grabe, it’s a different kind of pain, diba? Missing birthdays, missing fiestas, watching your kids grow up on a small phone screen, never being able to smell your wife’s cooking or feel your child’s hug after a long day. You endure all of this. For them.

            Let us be clear. This is a sacred path, a path of honor. We have nothing but the highest respect for this sacrifice. It has built homes and sent thousands to college. This is a truth nobody can question.
