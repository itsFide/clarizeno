            We come from a culture of sipag at tiyaga (hard work and perseverance). We know that nothing worthwhile comes easy. We are taught to rely on our own efforts and on the strength of our community. The spirit of bayanihan, where we lift each other’s burdens, is our greatest treasure.

            The new knowledge about financial psychology is not here to replace these timeless values. Instead, it is a tool to strengthen them. Think of it this way: our hard work is the engine, and understanding our mindset is the steering wheel. It helps us direct our efforts more wisely.

            When we learn to manage our own impulses and make conscious choices, we become better providers and more reliable members of our community. It’s about adding a layer of wisdom to the strength we already possess.
