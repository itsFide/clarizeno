            To your left is the <a href="">Path of Hope</a>. It is the honorable path of our fathers. You work, you sacrifice, and you hope. You hope the prices don’t rise again. You hope your parents stay healthy. You hope your boss will be fair. Your family's future is in the hands of hope… and hope is not a shield.

            To your right is the <a href="">Path of Control</a>. This path says hope is not a strategy. This is the path for men who decide to take control of their family’s destiny. You don’t hope for a better future - you build a machine that works to create it. A money machine that protects your family while you sleep, in a world that does not care about your hopes.
