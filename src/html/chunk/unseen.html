            <li>That honorable path is real. But your shield of hard work is being attacked every day by enemies you cannot see. The first is a <a href="">thief called Inflation.</a> Every night, he sneaks into your wife's wallet and steals a little bit of the money you worked so hard for. He is silent, invisible, and he never stops stealing from your family's table.</li>
            <li>The second is a <a href="">sniper called Sickness.</a> He is hiding, aiming at your loved ones, and you never know when he will pull the trigger. One hospital bill can be the bullet that kills years of your savings in an instant.</li>
            <li>The third is the most dangerous because he whispers in your own voice. He is the ghost of Hiya (shame). He is the pressure that makes you the ninong (godfather) who gives the biggest gift at the baptism, even if it means taking another secret loan. He is the shame that stops you from admitting to your wife that you can’t afford to fix the leaking roof this year... again.</li>
            <li>Your shield of hard work is strong, but it was not made to fight these ghosts and thieves. The Path of Sacrifice no longer guarantees a win. It’s not your fault. The enemies just don't fight fair anymore.</li>
