            This Path of Control is not for everyone. It is not for dreamers who only talk. It is not
            for the lazy who wait for swerte(luck). It is only for men who are ready to ACT.
        </p>
        <p class="legacy__descr article-descr">
            That is why this symbolic $9 trial fee is not a ‘price’. It is your filter. With this, you
            prove to us, and more importantly to yourself, that you came here to WIN, not just to watch.
        </p>
        <p class="legacy__descr article-descr">
            The moment you pass this filter, you are instantly welcomed into our Bayan-our brotherhood.

                    <strong>Most Men Will Fail Here:</strong> They will close this page, go back to scrolling Facebook, and keep waiting for swerte (luck). They are mere watchers. Puro dada, kulang sa gawa (All talk, no action).

                <li>
                    <strong>The 60-Second Challenge:</strong> We prepared 4 honest questions. It will take less than a minute, but it will demand 100% truth from you.

                <li>
                    <strong>No Commitment Yet:</strong> This is just a conversation between men to see if you are ready. If you pass, you get invited. If not, no hard feelings.
