                The honor of your pamilya... it’s on your shoulders, diba? But it’s more than just a weight. It’s the quiet fear that the money will run out right when your mother needs her medicine. It’s the Hiya, the shame of seeing your son want the same new shoes as his friends, and you have to say, “maybe next month”… knowing deep inside that ‘next month’ may never come. If you are reading this, pare, this story is about you.
